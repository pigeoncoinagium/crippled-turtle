		<p>Thank you for adding /s to your post.<br>When I first saw this post, I was horrified. How could anybody say something like this?<br>I immediately began writing a 1000 word paragraph about how you don’t deserve oxygen.<br>I even sent a copy to my Harvard professor to proofread. After several hours of refining and editing, my comment was ready to absolutely destroy you.<br>But then, just as I was about to hit send, I saw something in the corner of my eye.<br>A “/s” at the end of your comment. Suddenly everything made sense! Your comment was sarcasm! I immediately burst out in laughter at the pure comedic genius.<br>The person next to me on the bus saw and started crying from laughter until he shit himself.<br>Before long, there was an entire bus of people on the floor laughing and filling their pants with shit at your incredible comedy.<br>All of this was due to you adding /s to your post. Thank you.</p>
